#PET BAG README

Overview
This pseudocode outlines the logic for a Pet Information System, a program designed to manage information about dogs and cats in a boarding facility. The system maintains a pet database, tracks available spaces for dogs and cats, and allows users to input and retrieve information about each pet.

Instructions
To understand and implement the pseudocode, follow these instructions:

Welcome Message:

The program starts by displaying a welcoming message to the user.
Initialization:

Initializes a pet database as a list to store pet records.
Sets the initial number of spaces for dogs and cats.
Main Loop:

Creates an infinite loop for continuous interaction with the user.
Pet Category Input:

Asks the user to specify whether the pet is a dog or a cat.
Checks available spaces for the specified category.
Name Input:

Prompts the user to enter the name of the pet.
Unique ID Generation:

Generates a unique ID for the pet based on criteria.
Checks if the ID already exists in the pet database.
Pet Record Handling:

Updates existing pet records or creates a new one based on the ID.
Type, Age, Weight, and Special Instructions Input:

Collects additional information about the pet, including type, age, weight, and special instructions.
Validation:

Ensures all required fields are filled.
Adds the pet record to the database and updates available spaces if the information is complete.
Output and User Prompt:

Displays the recorded pet information.
Asks the user if they want to add another pet.
Exit Loop:

Allows the user to exit the loop when they no longer want to add pets.
Database Save:

Saves the pet database to a more permanent storage system, such as a database.
Implementation
To implement this pseudocode, using Java. Create functions for input validation, ID generation, and database operations. Ensure proper error handling and user prompts for a smooth user experience. The pseudocode serves as a guide for building a functional Pet Information System.

Enjoy coding and managing pet information with the Pet Information System!
